Refreshing my rusty Rust skills, since I've decided to fight The Borrow Checker once again. [Did not go well 4 years ago](https://github.com/laacz/aoc-2021-rust).

Will be doing this until it gets too hard.

## Day 01 .. 05

Struggled a bit. Mainly due the unfamiliarity with Rust. Somehow it takes a longer while to translate my thinking into Rust than into Go, for example.
