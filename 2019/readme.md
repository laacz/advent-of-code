# 2019

Refreshing my rusty Rust skills, since I've decided to fight The Borrow Checker once again. [Did not go well 4 years ago](https://github.com/laacz/aoc-2021-rust).

Will be doing this until it gets too hard.

## Day 01 .. 05

Easy enough.

## Day 06

First part was easy enough. Got lost with actual Rust implementation tho.

Struggled a bit more with the second part. Mainly due the unfamiliarity with Rust. Somehow it takes a longer while to translate my thinking into Rust than into Go, for example.

## Day 07

This. Just. Sucked.

## Day 08

A compensation for day 07 probably.

## Day 09

That damned Intcode computer again. To make my life even harder, decided to implement it as a type. I dislike these large programs as AoC solutions. Part 2 was a nice surprise for the late night.

## Day 10

Task was simple, implementation not. Still getting used to the ways of Rust. Regarding solution - the formulas are not living in my head, so looked them up. Without web search I wouldn't be able to code anything beyond simple straightforward stuff.

## Day 11

Once more that damned Intcode computer. Nevertheless - look how pretty! Yeah, procrastinated a bit :)
