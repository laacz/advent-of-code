# 2019

Refreshing my rusty Rust skills, since I've decided to fight The Borrow Checker once again. [Did not go well 4 years ago](https://github.com/laacz/aoc-2021-rust).

Will be doing this until it gets too hard.

## Day 01 .. 05

Easy enough.

## Day 06

First part was easy enough. Got lost with actual Rust implementation tho.

Struggled a bit more with the second part. Mainly due the unfamiliarity with Rust. Somehow it takes a longer while to translate my thinking into Rust than into Go, for example.

## Day 07

This. Just. Sucked.
