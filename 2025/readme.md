# Advent of Code 2025

Rust. Let's cry alone.

## Day 1

Could not figure out math for part 2 with left rotations. Ended up brute forcing. Feeling ashamed already. More anxiety to come!

## Day 2

Already a challange. Part 1 looks clean, but because I cleaned up some 50 lines of spaghetti or so. For part 2 did brute force, as input did not give extreme ranges.
