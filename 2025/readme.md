# Advent of Code 2025

Rust. Let's cry alone.

## Day 1

Could not figure out math for part 2 with left rotations. Ended up brute forcing. Feeling ashamed already. More anxiety to come!

## Day 2

Already a challenge. Part 1 looks clean, but because I cleaned up some 50 lines of spaghetti or so. For part 2 did brute force, as input did not give extreme ranges.

## Day 3

This was so neat. Part 1 was simple. In part 2 we had to think about algorithmic approach of finding max in a given window, noting its position, doing that 12 times.

## Day 4

Nice and simple.
